Morpheus: Take your junk with you. Keep your surroundings clean.
Neo: How can I do both? If I took my junk with me, my surroundings would not be clean, would it?
Morpheus: You can do more than any of us. You are the one! Believe!
Neo: I don't understand what you said. But I've come to realize that this is how you talk. In riddles!!!
